# HEP data analysis using convolutional neural network

Implementing 4 deep learning schemes for HEP analysis - algorithms here are specifically calibrated for strong gravitational lensing images.

* ConvNet Classification: Aimed at automated identification of lensing images in astronomical surveys.
* ConvNet Regression: For a non-linear regression on strong lensing images from the simulations. 
* Convolutional Autoencoders: To extract low-level features in lensing images and use them for denoising astronomical images, faster classification algorithms etc. 
* Generative Adversarial Networks (under development): Aimed at generating new images from convolutional networks trained from simulated images.
